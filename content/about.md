# About Us

We are an interdiciplanary group of researchers at the University of British Columbia who are broadly interested in causal inference and information theory, especially for applications where we want to learn more about the true data generating processes behind some observational data.

If you would like to join us and help with organizing future events, feel free to contact us.
